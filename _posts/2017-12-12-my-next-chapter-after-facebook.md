In 2010, I was weighing a heavy decision. I had two compelling job offers. Do I return to the Ads Product Marketing team at Facebook, where I had interned and continued to work part time during grad school? Or do I join Google as a Product Manager?

## I joined Facebook in 2010

I chose Facebook [because it was the less certain, higher beta path](https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-ever-turned-down-a-job-offer-from-Google-If-so-why/answer/Scott-Shapiro). I was beyond impressed with everyone there and fell in love with the energy at 1601 California Ave. I was also at a place in my life where I wanted to take bigger bets. I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on what could be a once in a lifetime company.

But I&#8217;ve always wondered what the other decision would have been like. To join Google. Now I&#8217;m about to find out. I&#8217;m joining Google to lead a team of product managers in Ads Measurement, an area I&#8217;ve been working in for almost a decade. The greater team works on products like [Google Analytics, which I&#8217;ve been a consistent user of since 2006.](http://avc.com/2009/07/do-windows-and-mac-users-read-blogs-differently/) I have no doubt that Google will continue shaping the future of this industry and I&#8217;m excited to be a part of it.

## Leaving Facebook after 7 years was one of the hardest decisions I&#8217;ve made

I loved my time at Facebook. I grew from an intern, to a full time individual contributor. Then a manager and ultimately a manager of managers. I got to take retargeting mainstream via Facebook Exchange and Website Custom Audiences. I was a founding member of the Ad Tech and Measurement organizations. I made an appearance in _Chaos Monkeys_. I worked with some of the best people in the business from Buenos Aires to Stockholm to Singapore and many places in between. These years are comprised of career experiences I never imagined myself having.

But earlier this summer, I realized I need a change to help me continue growing. To get out of my comfort zone. I had been performing the same function in the same domain at the same company for many years. I was also the most tenured Ads Product Marketer at Facebook.

## Why I&#8217;m joining Google

I&#8217;ve always had massive respect for Google, and coincidentally they reached out about a role as the summer wound down. After a few months of conversations, I realized there was a very compelling path to growth. A new, but related function (product management) in a different company. But in a similar domain (ads measurement) and location (SF Bay Area). This was what I needed to take the next step in my career and begin a new chapter.

2017 was an amazing year of personal and professional growth, but I can&#8217;t wait for 2018.
