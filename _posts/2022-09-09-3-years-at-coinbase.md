_A quick history of my first three years working in crypto_

<!--more-->

I just reached three years at Coinbase.

When I left Google in 2019, the reactions mostly ranged from "didn't crypto die a couple years ago?" to "why would anyone leave the comfort of Google?"

For me it was a no-brainer. To have a chance to dedicate myself something I deeply believe in long-term: crypto. Something I was spending nights and weekends tinkering with for years. We were only a few months away from having our second child, so it was either then or waiting a much longer time.
