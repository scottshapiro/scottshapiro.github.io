_I recently started building a Messenger Bot. This is a series describing how I approached it and what I learned._

## Why build a bot?

I had a specific problem to solve: was my rooftop solar power system working?

Wait, what does a [bot](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/chat_bot.html) have to do with power production? That sounds like a ridiculous question today. 10 years from now it won&#8217;t. Bots are going to be the future of how we interact with products and services.

In addition to solving a real problem, I chose to go down this path for several reasons:  
1. I wanted to understand this trend around bots: how you build them, what you could have them do  
2. I haven&#8217;t coded anything in years, and wanted to see what I could still accomplish  
3. Get my hands dirty on a bunch of new technologies like Heroku and Git (okay, these are not so new but very new to me)

## Problem

My rooftop solar power system sometimes trips the circuit breaker. But there were no quick ways to be notified of a problem. The only way was by looking at my power bill. My surprise-almost-three-hundred-dollar-bill!

I had stopped looking at these bills several years ago because we are a net producer of power. I never have a bill to pay and in fact over produce by several hundred dollars a year (separate topic on how I could monetize that power). This all changed last year when our system stopped producing power for several months. This all could have been avoided.

## What I need in a solution

Notifications above everything else are a must have. Alerts and monitoring. Push is way more valuable than pull in my case.

The sooner I get notified of a problem, the faster I can fix it. The faster I&#8217;m producing power again. So I need a notification channel beyond the monthly reports that the system (now finally) e-mails me.

A very secondary use case is reporting. This is a nice to have. There is a mobile app for my solar system but it&#8217;s awful. Something that summarizes reports and doesn&#8217;t ask me to log in each time would be much nicer than PG&E&#8217;s system too.

_Next post I&#8217;ll talk about why I chose messenger over alternatives._
