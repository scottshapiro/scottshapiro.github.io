I love Booking.com. It&#8217;s my favorite travel reservation site.

I often book way more reservations than I&#8217;ll ever use. Sometimes I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll actually be able to travel. Other times I&#8217;m not sure where the weather will be best. I love optionality.

But it&#8217;s hard to keep track of all the reservations I make. Specifically, when I can still cancel without a fee. Booking heavily markets &#8220;free cancellation&#8221; as a feature, but doesn&#8217;t want to incentivize cancellations.

I searched around for apps that might scan your gmail or connect to Booking.com and notify you. But I couldn&#8217;t find anything. This is just like when [I struggled to get notified if my solar power system was down]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-27-im-building-a-bot %}).
So I built a tiny app that solves this problem.

I used Google Scripts, which is just like JavaScript. It has a bunch of features that work directly with gmail and Google Calendar. Two apps that I use all the time. So long as I could scan my email for incoming Booking.com reservations and then create a notification in my calendar, I&#8217;d be set.

This was pretty simple once I figured out the object model. Fewer than 100 lines of code and I&#8217;m all set. [I put the project up on GitHub](https://github.com/scottshapiro/bookingNotifications) if anyone wants to use it or improve it.

The next step would be to create a hosted app, but it&#8217;s easy enough to set up on your own. [See the README](https://github.com/scottshapiro/bookingNotifications/blob/master/README.md).
