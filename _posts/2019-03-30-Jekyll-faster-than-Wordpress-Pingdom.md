I just setup a Jekyll version of this blog, hosted on GitHub Pages. It loads 10x faster than the Wordpress version and my Pingdom score went from a D to an A. Granted it doesn’t have all the same functionality, but I’m more okay with that.

### Wordpress
`Load time of http://www.scottshapiro.com/ w. Pingdom Tools 3154 ms. Size: 744.2 KB. Requests: 59. https://tools.pingdom.com/#5a7537a129800000`

### Jekyll
`Load time of http://www.shap.ro/ w. Pingdom Tools 313 ms. Size: 81.6 KB. Requests: 7. https://tools.pingdom.com/#5a7538068a800000`
