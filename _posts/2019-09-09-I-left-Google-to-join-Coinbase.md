_Last week, I started working at Coinbase in San Francisco. My new job is to lead the core consumer app product team. We are working to make cryptocurrency more useful for everyone._

This is a huge change for me. I spent the past nine years building marketing products at Facebook and Google. I had a courtside seat to so many innovations in digital advertising. This includes real-time bidding, cross-device targeting, and data-driven measurement.

But for the past six years, I’ve become obsessed with cyptocurrency. It all started when [I bought my first bitcoin in 2013, on Coinbase]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-17-my-first-year-in-bitcoin-2013 %}). On nights and weekends, I find myself gravitating towards [new projects in cypto like Lightning Network]({% post_url 2018-02-09-cryptocurrency-lightning-network %}). I've spun up a handful of cryptocurrency nodes as fun side projects.

I listen to crypto podcasts during my commute and workouts. I read about how companies across the crypto ecosystem are moving the ball forward. I watch news about how macroeconomics are evolving. And I believe that the financial system will begin to look a lot different over the next decade.

Crypto today feels a lot like Social in 2010, when I first interviewed at Facebook. At the time, friends and family were skeptical of social networks. Facebook had only a fraction of the users it has today and an even smaller fraction of its revenue. Very few marketers put real effort into digital, let alone, social advertising. A passing fad was how most of the world saw these innovations. Innovations that I believed in, deep down.

Many people express those same skeptical feelings about cryptocurrency. There’s a general awareness. And some friends and family have even dabbled. But most raise an eyebrow.

So when the opportunity to have a front-row seat to crypto presented itself, I couldn’t look the other way. Coinbase is one of the few companies in the world that has the potential to bring crypto mainstream. And this is a chance for me to expand into consumer products and turn a passion into a career. An opportunity to grab a seat on this rocket ship is not something that might ever present itself again. So I jumped on board.
