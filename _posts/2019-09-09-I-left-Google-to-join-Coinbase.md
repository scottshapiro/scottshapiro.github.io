Last week, I started a new job at Coinbase in San Francisco. I will be leading the core consumer app product team. 

This is a huge change for me. I spent the past nine years building and scaling digital marketing and analytics products. I worked at Facebook and Google on the Peninsula, commuting every day 35 miles on the 101 freeway. I had a front seat to so many innovations in marketing, like real-time bidding and cross-device targeting and measurement. 

But for the past six years, I've become increasingly obsessed with cyptocurrency. It all started when [I bought my first bitcoin in 2013, on Coinbase]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-17-my-first-year-in-bitcoin-2013 %}). On nights and weekends, I find myself gravitating towards [new projects in cypto like Lightning Network]({% post_url 2018-02-09-cryptocurrency-lightning-network %}). I've spun up a handful of nodes, all just for fun.

I listen to crypto podcasts during my two hour commute. I read about how companies like Coinbase are moving the ball forward. I watch news about how macroeconomics are evolving. And I have to believe that the the financial system will begin to look a lot different over the next decade. 

This situation reminds me a lot of Facebook when I first interviewed in 2009. At the time, friends and family were skeptical of social networks. Facebook had only a fraction of the users it has today and an even smaller fraction of its revenue. Very few marketers took digital, let alone, social advertising seriously. A passing fad was how most of the world saw these innovations. Innovations that I believed in, deep down. 

Crypto today feels a lot like Social in 2009. There's a general awaress of the concept, but there are skeptics abound. Some friends and family have even dabbled, but most don't take it seriously. 

So when the opportunity to have a front-row seat to cypto, at a leader in the space, in San Francisco presented itself, I couldn't look the other way. I got to know the team very well, and was thrilled by everyone's enthusiasm. Coinbase is one of the few companies in the world that is positioned to bring crypto mainstream. Having the opportunity to grab a seat on this rocket ship is not something that might ever present itself again. So I jumped on board.
