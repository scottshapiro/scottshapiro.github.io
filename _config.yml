  greetings: Hi, I'm Scott Shapiro.
  description: I've been working in technology in the Bay Area for the last nine years.
    I've become obsessed with cryptocurrency over the last six. I love pushing myself
    out of my comfort zone, whether technical or physical. This blog serves as a partial
    record of those attempts.
  bio: Scott is a product manager in San Francisco. He has as BS in Computer Science
    from UC San Diego and an MBA from UC Berkeley.
